The character was performed by Johnny Depp. He is one of the most original, inventive, unexpected, unpredictable and delightful characters in movie history, and that is attributable to Johnny determination not to take the roads most traveled. He's entirely self-serving, but can surprisingly come through heroically in a pinch. He pretends not to care about anyone or anything except himself, but when push comes to shove, Captain Jack does have a  heart after all. And most of all, he loves and cherishes his freedom, sailing the seas on his greatest love of all, the Black Pearl.</p><h4>Tushar</h4><h4>2019-01-03</h4></div><div><h2>Iron Man</h2><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tushartambe/imagesForHTML/master/ironman.jpg"alt="Iron Man"><p>Iron Man is a fictional superhero in Marvel cinematic universe.
